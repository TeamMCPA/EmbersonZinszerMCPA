# EmbersonZinszerMCPA
Implement multichannel pattern analysis (MCPA) with NIRS a la Emberson, Zinszer, Raizada and Aslin

If you want to be alerted of updates to the code, please email Benjamin Zinszer bzinszer@gmail.com. You will only receive emails if there are significant changes made to the code. Alternatively, come back and visit this github repository because changes will be pushed to this location.

Two datasets were used in the paper. Dataset #1 has been published in Emberson, Richards & Aslin (2015, control group) and is available in full here:

Dataset #2 has yet to be published and thus the original dataset is not yet available in this repository.

The output of this code (i.e., decoding accuracy) is available for both datasets, along with the code used for implementing the mixed effects models reported in Emberson, Zinszer, Raizada and Aslin is available in a complementary repository https://github.com/laurenemberson/EmbersonZinszerMCPA_analysesFromPaper.

If you have questions, please email either Lauren Emberson lauren.emberson@gmail.com or Benjamin Zinszer bzinszer@gmail.com.
